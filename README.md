# Elite School Webpage

This is my first project using **HTML and CSS**.  
It is a simple school webpage with sections for:

- Welcome message and navigation menu  
- List of school programs  
- Admissions information  
- Contact details  
- Footer and quick links  

## Features Demonstrated
- Correct linkage of HTML and CSS files  
- Use of different CSS selectors and properties  
- Application of the **Box Model** (margins, padding, and borders)  
- Organized and readable CSS code with comments  

## Files
- `index.html` → the main HTML page  
- `style.css` → the CSS styling file  
- `README.md` → project description
