🧮 Mini Calculator
A simple, interactive Python mini-calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. It’s user-friendly, works with decimals, and even adds a dash of humor! 😎

Features
Works with decimal numbers (not just integers!)

Returns the sum, difference, product, and quotient of your input numbers

Interactive and easy to use

Clear, helpful prompts

Beginner-friendly code with comments and fun emoji explanations

How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3 or later).

Copy the code from calculator.py into your favorite code editor or just use the script below.

Run the script:

bash
python calculator.py
Follow the instructions—enter your two numbers when prompted.

See your results for the four math operations.

Example
text
Enter the first number: 12.5
Enter the second number: 4.5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 17.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 56.25
Quotient: 2.7777777777777777
Code
python
# We're going to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! 😎

# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
# We're using 'float()' to make sure our numbers can have decimals too. Fancy, right? ✨
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
# Same trick here—using 'float()' for decimal magic! 🧙‍♂️
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Step 3: Time to do some math! 🧠 Let's compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# Add the two numbers (Yay! Addition is the first step to fun!) ➕
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Subtract the second number from the first (Negative vibes, but necessary! 😜) ➖
difference_result = num1 - num2

# Multiply the two numbers (More bang for your buck! 💥) ✖️
product_result = num1 * num2

# Divide the first number by the second (Be careful with zero here, no math disasters! 😅) ➗
# We'll assume the user is being responsible and not dividing by zero for now!
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Step 4: Show the user what we got! 🥳 Time for the big reveal! 🎉
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")  # ➕
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")  # ➖
print(f"Product: {product_result}")  # ✖️
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")  # ➗

# 🏁 And that's it! You've just made a mini-calculator! 😎💻
Notes
The program assumes you enter valid numbers.

Division by zero isn’t handled—enter a non-zero second number (or feel free to improve the code!).

Perfect for learning Python basics and having fun with simple math operations.
